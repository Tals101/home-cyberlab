# AI Log Analysis Agent

A beginner-friendly AI security project that uses a local LLM through Ollama to analyze Linux authentication logs and generate a SOC-style incident summary.

---

## Project Summary

This project was built in a home cybersecurity lab to combine:

- Linux log analysis
- Python automation
- Local LLM inference
- SOC-style incident reporting

The agent reads authentication logs, looks for suspicious activity, and produces a structured security assessment with severity, attack hypothesis, and mitigation guidance.

---

## Objectives

- Build a simple AI-assisted SOC workflow
- Analyze Linux authentication logs locally
- Use Ollama for private LLM inference
- Create a portfolio-ready cybersecurity automation project

---

## Tools Used

- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu Server
- Metasploitable2
- VirtualBox
- Python 3
- Ollama
- Llama 3.2 3B
- LangChain

---

## Features

- Reads Linux authentication log data
- Detects suspicious login behavior
- Produces SOC-style analysis
- Works fully in a local lab
- Saves report output for documentation and review

## How It Works

1. A sample authentication log is provided to the Python script.
2. The script sends the log content to a local Ollama model.
3. The model analyzes the log data.
4. The agent returns:
   - Severity level
   - Suspicious activity summary
   - Attack hypothesis
   - Recommended mitigation steps

---

## Example Workflow

- Review authentication logs
- Identify repeated failed login attempts
- Flag suspicious access patterns
- Generate a short incident-style response

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Virtual lab setup
- Linux command-line usage
- Python scripting
- Local LLM deployment
- AI-assisted log analysis
- Security reporting
- Basic SOC workflow automation

---

## Notes

This is a local lab project created for learning and portfolio development. It is intentionally simple and designed as a foundation for more advanced projects such as:

- AI-driven vulnerability scanning
- SIEM alert summarization
- Threat hunting automation
- Multi-agent red vs blue simulations
